# Voting App
Full stack voting app.

Live Demo: (coming soon)

Built with React, Redux and Styled-Components on the front end. Node.js, Express and MongoDB on the back end.

User Stories:
* As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
* As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
* As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
* As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
* As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
* As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
